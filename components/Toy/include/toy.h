 Each step is as follows:

 source   -> lexer       -> token
 token    -> parser      -> AST
 AST      -> compiler    -> bytecode
 bytecode -> interpreter -> result

 I should note that the parser -> compiler phase is actually made up of two steps - the write step
 and the collate step. See `Toy_compileString()` in `repl/repl_tools.c` for an example of how to compile
 properly.

/* building block structures - the basic units of operation

 Literals represent any value within the language, including some internal ones that you never see.
 Literal Arrays are literally arrays within memory, and are the most heavily used structure in Toy.
 Literal Dictionaries are unordered key-value hashmaps, that use a running strategy for collisions.

/* other components - you probably won't use these directly, but they're a good learning opportunity.

 `Toy_Scope` holds the variables of a specific scope within Toy - be it a script, a function, a block, etc.
 Scopes are also where the type system lives at runtime. They use identifier literals as keys, exclusively.

 `Toy_RefString` is a utility class that wraps traditional C strings, making them less memory intensive and
 faster to copy and move. In reality, since strings are considered immutable, multiple variables can point
 to the same string to save memory, and you can just create a new one of these vars pointing to the original
 rather than copying entirely for a speed boost. This module has it's own memory allocator system that is
 plugged into the main memory allocator.

 `Toy_RefFunction` acts similarly to `Toy_RefString`, but instead operates on function bytecode.
